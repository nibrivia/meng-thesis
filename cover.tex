% If you wish to list your previous degrees on the cover page, use the 
% previous degrees command:
\prevdegrees{B.S., Massachusetts Institute of Technology (2018)}
% You can use the \\ command to list multiple previous degrees
%       \prevdegrees{B.S., University of California (1978) \\
%                    S.M., Massachusetts Institute of Technology (1981)}
\department{Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science}

% If the thesis is for two degrees simultaneously, list them both
% separated by \and like this:
% \degree{Doctor of Philosophy \and Master of Science}
\degree{Master of Engineering in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science}

% As of the 2007-08 academic year, valid degree months are September, 
% February, or June.  The default is June.

%% By default, the thesis will be copyrighted to MIT.  If you need to copyright
%% the thesis to yourself, just specify the `vi' documentclass option.  If for
%% some reason you want to exactly specify the copyright notice text, you can
%% use the \copyrightnoticetext command.  
%\copyrightnoticetext{\copyright IBM, 1990.  Do not open till Xmas.}

% If there is more than one supervisor, use the \supervisor command
% once for each.
\supervisor{Manya Ghobadi}{Assistant Professor}

% This is the department committee chairman, not the thesis committee
% chairman.  You should replace this with your Department's Committee
% Chairman.
\chairman{Katrina LaCurts}{Chair, Master of Engineering Thesis Committee}

% Make the titlepage based on the above information.  If you need
% something special and can't use the standard form, you can specify
% the exact text of the titlepage yourself.  Put it in a titlepage
% environment and leave blank lines where you want vertical space.
% The spaces will be adjusted to fill the entire page.  The dotted
% lines for the signatures are made with the \signature command.
\maketitle

% The abstractpage environment sets up everything on the page except
% the text itself.  The title and other header material are put at the
% top of the page, and the supervisors are listed at the bottom.  A
% new page is begun both before and after.  Of course, an abstract may
% be more than one page itself.  If you need more control over the
% format of the page, you can use the abstract environment, which puts
% the word "Abstract" at the beginning and single spaces its text.

%% You can either \input (*not* \include) your abstract file, or you can put
%% the text of the abstract directly between the \begin{abstractpage} and
%% \end{abstractpage} commands.

% First copy: start a new page, and save the page number.
\cleardoublepage
% Uncomment the next line if you do NOT want a page number on your
% abstract and acknowledgments pages.
% \pagestyle{empty}
\setcounter{savepage}{\thepage}
\begin{abstractpage}
\input{abstract}
\end{abstractpage}

% Additional copy: start a new page, and reset the page number.  This way,
% the second copy of the abstract is not counted as separate pages.
% Uncomment the next 6 lines if you need two copies of the abstract
% page.
% \setcounter{page}{\thesavepage}
% \begin{abstractpage}
% \input{abstract}

\section*{Acknowledgments}

% yeah, this will be made better, it was just too funny not to write
There's a large packet of people who are behind this thesis.

Dr Chris Terman and Dr Katrina LaCurts for being an amazing cache of inspiration, advice, and wisdom, and for supporting my teaching and making sure it was recognized by department and by MIT.
Sam Cutler for reliably bringing order to my struggles with Rust's borrow checker, and for shared excitement over systems.

The EECS department for funding me through teaching for the past 3 years.
Professor Manya Ghobadi for summer funding, for introducing me to the world of networking research, and for her academic guidance.
To all the developers of Rust and crossbeam for supporting my needs in high-performance parallel world, without whom large sections of this thesis would not have been possible so fast.
To the countless researchers and engineers whose work these projects are based on. %cite, cite

Christina Meyer, Oomi Pammit, and Iris Hwang for being excellent friends and remote work buddies during this pandemic.
More generally, to all the women in STEM who quietly support each other.
\\

This timeout has lasted for far too long, so let's acknowledge TCP for establishing order on the internet.
To it, and all those above, thank you.
